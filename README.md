## Problem Statement:
Adblocking is significantly reducing GYFâ€™s ad impressions, especially on mobile, threatening its core revenue model and weakening advertiser trust. This also hinders data collection for personalized marketing, reducing effectiveness and ROI for advertisers.
## Proposed Solution:
Implement native ads that are less likely to be blocked and personalize them using machine learning based on impression history. An optimization model will guide ad scheduling while maintaining user satisfaction. Results will be measured via KPIs like CTR, ad revenue, and advertiser retention using tools like Power BI and A/B testing.
